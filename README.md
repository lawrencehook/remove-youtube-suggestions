### Why I made it
The attention economy has gotten out of control. YouTube's recommendation algorithm optimizes for the most _engaging_ videos, not the ones you actually want to watch — and it's easy to lose hours to the rabbit hole. This extension lets you cut the noise and use YouTube on your own terms.
