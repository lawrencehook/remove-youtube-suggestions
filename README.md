### What
This extension hides recommended videos on YouTube and allows customization of the user interface to be less engaging.

### Why
Motivated by an attempt to stymie the YouTube rabbit hole.

The YouTube recommendation algorithm optimizes for the most _engaging_ videos, regardless of whether or not you are interested. Persistent exposure to these suggestions results in a waste of your time. So download this add-on and remove unwanted suggestions as you please.
